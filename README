About:
------------------------------------------------------------
This program will hopefully make it easier to compile
source code written in the go programming language.
A dependency graph is constructed from imports, this
is sorted with a topological sort to figure out legal
compile order. Testing, formatting and building reverse
dependencies through goinstall are also automated.


Install:  [Linux/Unix/Mac/Windows]
------------------------------------------------------------

Compile and link the makefile, you may want to substitute
8g and 8l with 6g/5g and 6l/5l pending on your architecture


1) 8g gdmake.go
2) 8l -o gdmake gdmake.8   # on Windows gdmake.exe
3) ./gdmake install        # on Windows gdmake.exe install

This will compile + link the binary (gd) and move it
to $HOME/bin if it is present, if not it falls back to
$GOBIN, which is required now.


./gdmake -help   to see all available targets


Try it Out:
------------------------------------------------------------

You can try to compile the same source using the generated
executable: gd


$ gd src          # will compile source inside src
$ gd -p src       # will print dependency info gathered
$ gd -s src       # will print legal compile order
$ gd src -test    # will run unit-tests
$ gd src -fmt     # will format (gofmt) the source-code
$ gd src -o gd    # will compile and link executable
$ gd -e src       # will goinstall external dependencies

Philosophy (Babble?)
------------------------------------------------------------

Without a tool to figure out which order the source should
be compiled, Makefiles are usually the result. Makefiles
are static in nature, which make them a poor choice to handle
a dynamic problem like a changing source tree. They also make
flat structures quite common, since this usually simplifies
the Makefiles, but makes organisation far less intuitive than
a directory-tree package-structure.


Completion
------------------------------------------------------------

Bash completion scripts for gd and gdmake are placed in util


Logo
------------------------------------------------------------

The logo was made with LaTeX and tikz, it's basically just
an upside down g filled with yellow..
